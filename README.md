# Tuned random forest for Prediction-of-Product-Sales
## Subtitle describing the analysis 
**Author**: Fadi Theodory
### Business problem:
The first project will be a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores. The goal of this is to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.
# Methods
We would dive into data to understand what does affect the sales
Sales prediction for food items sold at various stores
#### Visual 1: Outlet size vs sales

#### Visual 2: Outlet Size vs Item Outlet Sales divided by location type

## Results
> in Visual 1, we could see that the medium outlet size has the highest sales.
> in Visual 2, we noticed that tier 3 in the medium size is the highest sales.


## Model

We used linear regression and random forest regressor
the metrics for random forest were as followig:
**Results of the tuned random forests Regression Metrics: Training Data**
MAE = 653.581
MSE = 868,838.966
RMSE = 932.115
R^2 = 0.706

**Regression Metrics: Test Data**
MAE = 734.559
MSE = 1,118,876.716
RMSE = 1,057.770
R^2 = 0.594

we can see that the model is over fitting
However, i

Refer to the metrics to describe how well the model would solve the business problem
